#File Similarity Comparison Application

This Spring Boot application compares a reference text file (File A) against a pool of text files to determine which file in the pool matches File A the most. The application calculates a similarity score based on the word intersection between File A and each file in the pool. The score helps identify the file that is most similar to File A.
